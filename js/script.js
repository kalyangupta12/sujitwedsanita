 * Despite so many new Bollywood and English song options, I prefered to use two-decade-old song, Din Shagna Da!

 * Ever attended a North Indian Wedding? As soon as the DJ plays Din Shagna Da song, it means that the much-awaited moment is here
 * and the bride is all set to put her first foot forward to the wedding venue under a breathtaking phoolon ki chaadar.
 * Let's keep the sky-high status of this song untouched!
 *
 * When the website is backed up with a soul-stirring track, the feeling becomes absolutely surreal. 
 * Choose a heart-touching track! üéµ ‚ù§Ô∏è
